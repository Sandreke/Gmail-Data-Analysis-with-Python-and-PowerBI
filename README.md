# Gmail-Data-Analysis-with-Python-and-PowerBI
The project consists of web scraping, cleaning and transforming the email data from my personal [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) account with [Python](https://www.python.org/). Besides, visualizations are added using [Power BI](https://lnkd.in/ewuiReWm) in order to identify the top 10 senders with the highest volume of emails, create a Word Cloud that generates the most used words in subjects, and measure that volume per year, month, day and hour.
